# GardenLocator

Welcome to the GardenLocator ruby gem. This web scraper scrapes the wikipedia of the list of botanical gardens and arboretums in Florida. The url that it scrapes is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_botanical_gardens_and_arboretums_in_Florida . The information displayed will show a garden list and an overview of gardens that you can visit in Florida. 

I created this project as part of my Module I while attending the Flatiron School in 2020. The project requirement was to create a CLI RUBY GEM using the Nokogiri scraper gem. It continues to be maintained by the creator.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'garden_locator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install garden_locator

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
